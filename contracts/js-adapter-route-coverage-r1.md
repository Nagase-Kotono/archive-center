# JS Adapter Route Coverage Audit — R1

> Historical Archive Center 2.0 R0/R1 contract/evidence, reviewed 2026-09-08.
> “Current”, “planned” and route/schema counts below refer to that original snapshot.
> For active Go/Host ownership and implemented routes, use [STRUCTURE](../STRUCTURE.md)
> and [AI_GUARDRAILS](../AI_GUARDRAILS.md), checked against active source.
> This notice preserves the original contract; it does not declare a new API or schema.

> **Status**: R1 shadow evidence artifact for progress items `2.0-4k` and `2.0-4m`.
> This is **not** a product-readiness or green-gate claim. It documents which
> 0.8 JS adapter bridge routes have corresponding Go surface in 2.0 and at
> what implementation level.

## Method

- **0.8 source** (read-only reference): `Archive Center Beta 0.8(fix)/Archive Center.js`
  — all `bridgeFetch` / `bridgeFetchWithRetry` call targets extracted.
- **2.0 source**: `go-service/internal/httpapi/*.go` — all `mux.HandleFunc`
  registrations and handler implementations inspected.
- Each route family is classified by current 2.0 Go status.

## Status Legend

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **R1-read** | Handler runs Store/Vector-backed reads; returns real evidence under R1 constraints. |
| **R1-shadow** | Handler returns shadow/plan shape; no real mutation or upstream call. |
| **R1-degraded** | Handler returns safe empty/degraded shape when Store/Vector is ErrNotEnabled. |
| **R2-guarded** | Handler returns `writeShadowGuard` 503; mutation blocked until R2 cutover. |
| **R2-plan** | Handler returns a shadow plan object (e.g. rollback_plan, repair_replay_plan); no mutations. |
| **missing** | No Go route registered; needs follow-up. |

## 2.0-Only Routes (no 0.8 JS bridge target)

These Go routes have no direct 0.8 JS adapter bridge call. They are 2.0
additions for operational depth:

- Canonical CRUD: `GET/POST /canonical/{sid}/{table}` (16 routes)
- `GET /retrieval-index/{sid}`, `GET /retrieval-index/{sid}/source-row`
- `GET /intent-routing/runtime-config`, `GET /retrieval-index/runtime-config`
- `GET /canonical-state-layer/{sid}`, `GET /session/{sid}/active-scope`
- `GET /characters/{sid}/{name}/events`, `GET /characters/{sid}/{name}`
- `GET /episodes/detail/{id}`, `GET /long-session-health/{sid}`
- `GET /session/{sid}/resume-pack`, `GET /session/{sid}/step7-health`
- `GET /sessions/{sid}/export`, `GET /audit`, `GET /feedback/latest`
- `GET /metrics/lc1{c-p}/{sid}`, `GET /metrics/tm1d/{sid}`
- `GET /maintenance/queue-status`, `POST /maintenance/enqueue`, `POST /maintenance-pass/{sid}`
- `GET /ready`, `GET /version`

## Biggest Remaining Gaps (0.8 JS Adapter Perspective)

1. **Rollback/repair-replay mutation remains R2.** Both `DELETE /rollback/{turn_index}` and
   `POST /turns/repair-replay` return shadow plans only; no actual turn deletion or
   state rewind occurs in the Go service.

2. **Trust PATCH/DELETE surfaces are guarded.** All `/trust` PATCH routes
   (`storylines`, `world-rules`, `pending-threads`) and DELETE routes return 503.
   The 0.8 JS adapter calls these from settings panels and inline trust controls.

3. **Episode/chapter generation remains guarded.** `POST /episodes/generate`,
   `POST /chapters/generate`, `POST /arcs/generate`, `POST /sagas/generate`,
   `POST /episodes/regenerate`, `POST /episodes/merge` all return 503. The 0.8
   adapter triggers generation after turn completion and from explorer actions.

4. **Real live supervisor/critic remains disabled.** `POST /supervisor` and
   `POST /critic/test` return prompt-assembly traces and evidence counts but never
   call an upstream LLM. The 0.8 adapter depends on these for per-turn guidance
   and quality feedback.

5. **Real MariaDB-backed smoke/default switch still open.** All Store reads
   gracefully degrade to empty shapes on `ErrNotEnabled`, but no config flag or
   migration step currently enables live MariaDB as the default Store
   implementation. The `MariaDBEnabled` path exists in config but has no
   R1 verification against a running instance.

6. **Admin operations are guarded.** `POST /admin/rescan`, `/admin/reindex`,
   `/admin/session-migrate` return 503. The 0.8 adapter calls these from
   maintenance/debug panels.

7. **Proxy passthrough is blocked.** `POST /proxy/plugin-main` returns 503
   with validated endpoint. The 0.8 adapter uses this as the backend bundle
   entry point for coprocessor orchestration.

## Summary Counts

| Category | Count |
|---|---|
| R1-read (Store/Vector-backed) | ~30 |
| R1-shadow (plan/trace, no real effect) | ~8 |
| R2-guarded (503 blocked mutation) | ~30 |
| R2-plan (shadow plan, no mutation) | 2 |
| 2.0-only additions (no 0.8 bridge target) | ~25 |

**Bottom line**: All major 0.8 JS adapter bridge route families have a
corresponding Go registration in 2.0. Read-surface coverage is substantive
(Store-backed R1 evidence). This does not prove byte-for-byte runtime
compatibility for every query-string and trailing-slash variant; exact request
smoke remains required before `2.0-4k` can be green. The structural gap is
concentrated in write/mutation surfaces: ~30 R2-guarded routes need cutover
decisions before 0.8->2.0 behavioral parity can be claimed. No
product-readiness claim is made.
